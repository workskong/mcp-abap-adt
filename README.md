# MCP ABAP ADT Server

**MCP ABAP ADT Server** is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for ABAP Development Tools (ADT), providing unified access to SAP ABAP system metadata, source code, and runtime analysis. It exposes a rich set of APIs for DDIC inspection, ABAP object retrieval, trace/dump analysis, and repository search.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- **DDIC Inspection**: Structures, tables, CDS views, data elements, domains, and types.
- **ABAP Object Retrieval**: Programs, classes, function modules, function groups, includes, interfaces, message classes, packages, transactions.
- **Runtime Analysis**: ABAP trace listing and details, runtime dump listing and details.
- **Repository Search**: Object search (wildcard/regex).
- **Extensible Tool Registry**: All APIs are defined in `src/toolDefinitions.ts` for easy extension and MCP client integration.

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
## MCP ABAP ADT â€” Model Context Protocol server for ABAP

This repository implements an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes SAP ABAP Development Tools (ADT) functionality as a set of tools. Use it to query DDIC metadata, retrieve ABAP sources, inspect runtime dumps and traces, and run repository searches from any MCP-capable client.

This README is a focused reference: quick install, how to run locally, how to expose a remote MCP HTTP endpoint, SSE notes, Docker hints, tests, and contribution pointers.

## Quick summary

- Language: TypeScript (Node.js)
- Entry point: `dist/index.js` (build output)
- Source: `src/` â€” handlers are in `src/handlers/` and tools are registered in `src/toolDefinitions.ts`
- Tests: Jest (`npm test`)

## Features

- DDIC inspection (tables, structures, CDS, data elements, domains, types)
- Retrieve ABAP sources (classes, programs, includes, function modules, function groups, interfaces)
- Runtime diagnostics (ABAP short dumps and traces)
- Repository search (object search)
- Simple SSE (Server-Sent Events) channel to push events to connected clients
- Exposes both a local MCP server process mode and a small HTTP "remote" MCP adapter (`start-remote`)

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- Access to an SAP ABAP system with ADT enabled (for live queries)

## Get started (local development)

1. Clone and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/workskong/mcp-abap-adt.git
cd mcp-abap-adt
npm install
```

2. Copy environment template and edit credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env to add SAP_URL, SAP_USERNAME, SAP_PASSWORD, SAP_CLIENT, etc.
```

3. Build and run locally:

```bash
npm run build      # transpile TypeScript to dist/
npm start          # run the built MCP server (production mode)
```

For development with the MCP inspector:

```bash
npm run build
npm run dev        # runs inspector+server combo
```

## Environment variables

Use `.env` or set environment variables directly. Common variables in `.env.example`:

- SAP_URL â€” base URL for your ABAP system (e.g. https://sap.example.com:8000)
- SAP_USERNAME, SAP_PASSWORD â€” credentials for ADT access
- SAP_CLIENT â€” client number (e.g. 100)
- MCP_REMOTE_PORT â€” HTTP port for remote adapter (default: 6969)
- MCP_SSE_TOKEN â€” token used by SSE endpoints
- DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH â€” set to `true` to disable SSE auth for development only

Never commit real credentials. `.env` is gitignored by default.

## Running as a remote MCP HTTP adapter (remote access)

The project includes a small HTTP adapter implemented in `src/remoteServer.ts`. Use it when you want an HTTP-accessible MCP remote that exposes:

- `GET /tools` â€” list available tools and input schemas
- `POST /call` â€” call a tool by name with JSON body { name: string, arguments: { ... } }
- `GET /events` and `GET /sse` â€” SSE endpoints for real-time events (token protected)
- `POST /emit` â€” development helper to emit SSE events

Start the remote adapter:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start-remote
```

Remote adapter notes:

- By default it listens on port `6969` (configurable via `MCP_REMOTE_PORT` or `PORT`).
- SSE endpoints require the `MCP_SSE_TOKEN` (or set `DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH=true` in dev).
- The HTTP adapter implements a small subset of the MCP JSON-RPC transport: `initialize`, `tools/list`, and `tools/call` are supported.

Example: list tools

```bash
curl http://localhost:6969/tools
```

Example: call a tool

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:6969/call -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"name":"GetDDIC_Table","arguments":{"object_name":"SFLIGHT"}}'
```

## Local MCP process mode (embedding the server as an MCP process)

You can run the server as a local MCP process that MCP clients launch directly. This is handy for editor integrations that spawn an external process.

Example VS Code `.vscode/settings.json` snippet:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "abap-adt-local": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./dist/index.js"],
      "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
    }
  }
}
```

When run as a process, the server exposes the MCP HTTP-like JSON-RPC endpoints on STDIO or HTTP depending on the client; the included inspector command (`npm run dev`) demonstrates a typical development workflow.

## SSE (Server-Sent Events)

The remote adapter supports SSE. Use it to push events (tool output, diagnostics) to connected clients.

Client example (browser):

```javascript
const token = 'default-mcp-sse-token';
const es = new EventSource('http://localhost:6969/events?token=' + encodeURIComponent(token));
es.onmessage = e => console.log('msg', e.data);
es.addEventListener('mcptest', e => console.log('mcptest', e.data));
```

Emit an event from the server (dev helper):

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://localhost:6969/emit -Body (@{ event='mcptest'; data='hello'; topic='mytopic' } | ConvertTo-Json) -ContentType 'application/json' -Headers @{ Authorization = 'Bearer default-mcp-sse-token' }
```

## Docker (recommended)

This project includes a multi-stage `Dockerfile` (builder + runtime) that compiles the TypeScript sources and produces a minimal runtime image that runs `node dist/index.js`.

Quick commands (local build):

```bash
# build the image
docker build -t mcp-abap-adt:latest .

# run (map port 6969 -> 6969 and provide SAP credentials via env)
docker run --rm \
  -e SAP_URL="https://sap.example.com:8000" \
  -e SAP_USERNAME="your_user" \
  -e SAP_PASSWORD="your_password" \
  -e MCP_SSE_TOKEN="your_sse_token" \
  -p 6969:6969 \
  mcp-abap-adt:latest
```

Notes:

- The default runtime port exposed by the Dockerfile is `6969`. You can override the port with the `MCP_REMOTE_PORT` or `PORT` environment variable.
- The Dockerfile creates a non-root runtime user; do not run the container as root in production.
- Do not bake credentials into the image. Use environment variables, an external secret store, or Docker secrets.

Example `docker-compose.yml` (development-friendly):

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  mcp:
    build: .
    image: mcp-abap-adt:latest
    ports:
      - "6969:6969"
    environment:
      SAP_URL: "${SAP_URL}"
      SAP_USERNAME: "${SAP_USERNAME}"
      SAP_PASSWORD: "${SAP_PASSWORD}"
      MCP_SSE_TOKEN: "${MCP_SSE_TOKEN}"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Production tips:

- Use a secret manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure KeyVault) or Docker/Kubernetes secrets to inject credentials.
- For smaller runtime images consider using `node:18-slim` or a distroless base and copying only `dist/` + `package.json`/`package-lock.json` into the runtime image.
- If exposing the remote adapter publicly, place it behind a reverse proxy (TLS, auth) and restrict access to the ADT backend.

## Tests

Run the test suite with Jest:

```bash
npm test
```

Unit tests live under `tests/`. New handlers should include a unit test exercising the happy path and at least one error case.

## Extending and troubleshooting

- Tools are declared in `src/toolDefinitions.ts`. Add new entries to expose new MCP tools and point them at handler functions in `src/handlers/`.
- Handlers should be small, validate input, and call `makeAdtRequest()` or existing utility functions in `src/lib/`.
- If you see build errors, run `npm run build` and inspect the TypeScript output. Common fixes: missing exports in `src/handlers/index.ts` or wrong tool definitions.

## Security and best practices

- Do not store credentials in source. Use a secure secret store for production deployments.
- Use a strong `MCP_SSE_TOKEN` and avoid `DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH=true` outside local development.
- When exposing the remote adapter publicly, protect it behind a reverse proxy with TLS and authentication.
